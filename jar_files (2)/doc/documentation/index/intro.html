      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      
      
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Release 8.1.1 is the latest installment of Saxonica's progressive implementation of the 
         <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20" target="_blank" class="bodylink">XPath 2.0</a>, 
         <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20" target="_blank" class="bodylink">XSLT 2.0</a>, and
         <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery" target="_blank" class="bodylink">XQuery 1.0</a> specifications. 
         This release implements the schema-aware features of these languages, and also includes
         a free-standing schema processor conforming to 
         <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PER-xmlschema-1-20040318/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">XML Schema 1.0</a></p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon 8.1 has been developed in collaboration with 
         <a href="http://www.stylusstudio.com/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">Stylus Studio</a>. Release 6 of Stylus Studio takes
         advantage of new features introduced in this Saxon release to support stylesheet and query debugging.
         Saxonica is pleased to recommend Stylus Studio as a leading XML, XSLT, and XQuery development
         environment.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><b>Saxon 8.1 provides new functionality, improved performance, and better diagnostics.
            The licensing model for Saxon-SA is also more flexible, allowing a range of different feature
            combinations to be offered at different price levels.</b></p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The product is aligned with the working drafts published up to July 2004,
         though a few features are not yet implemented, and some changes have been made to implement
         decisions made by the working groups since those drafts were published.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon 8.1 is available in two versions. Saxon-B 8.1 is a non-schema-aware
         processor, and is available as an open-source product, free of charge, from 
         <a href="http://saxon.sf.net/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">SourceForge</a>. It is designed to conform to the
         basic conformance level of XSLT 2.0, and the equivalent level of functionality in XQuery 1.0. 
         Saxon-SA 8.1 is the schema-aware version of the package, and is available as a commercially
         supported product from <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">Saxonica Limited</a>.
         Licensing options are available to provide XSLT only, XQuery only, or schema validation
         only, as well as a full license that gives access to all functionality.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon 8.1.1 is a maintenance release that corrects several bugs found in 8.1.</p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">This documentation covers both products, with differences noted where applicable.</p>
      
      
      <div class="boxed" style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px">Please note: this documentation is provided on the 
         <a xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="http://www.saxonica.com/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">Saxonica</a> web site and also in the download file.
         On occasions the online version may be more up-to-date. The download file also includes full
         API documentation,: see the doc/api directory.

      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon 8.0 has been used for production applications by many users. The code is proving
         stable and reliable. However, you need to be aware that the specifications are still
         subject to change, and that new Saxon releases will track the changing specifications
         with no concessions to backward compatibility.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">If you are looking for complete stability, 
         the preferred version for production use remains
         <a href="http://saxon.sf.net/saxon6.5.3/" target="_blank" class="bodylink">Saxon 6.5.3</a>, which
         implements XSLT 1.0 and XPath 1.0.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Saxon 8.1 requires Java JDK 1.4. It is believed to run without problems on JDK 1.5, though
         it is not possible to compile the source under JDK 1.5 because of incompatibilities in the
         DOM interfaces.
